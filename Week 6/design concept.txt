PC side:
1. Check whether 5 seconds have passed (if that's the case, the current time_t is saved in some variable and next time time_t will be checked against this variable)
	1.1 If 5 seconds have passed, send the signal to the AVR to tell it to start measuring. One simple character like 'S' should do.
2. Check whether data has been received from the AVR
	2.1 If data has been received, output it into the text file along with timestamp

AVR side:
1. Check whether start signal 'S' has been received.
	1.1 If received, measure ADC, calculate and convert value into a string and send that over USART back to the PC.
