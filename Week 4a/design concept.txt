There are two main components: the main function and an interrupt based on TIMER0.
The interrupt will be used to time the notes (length of notes and BPM of the tune) and to select the to-be-played note.
The main function consists of an endless loop that will play a note from the table. This note will be generated by a PWM signal generated by TIMER1.

1. Initialize all needed components (load timer and DDR registers with values and stuff)
2. Select first note from the table.
3. Play note.
4. The timer interrupt kicks in and selects the next note (or rest or whatever is next in the table).
5. Play next note.
6. Step 3 and 4 are repeated endlessly.
