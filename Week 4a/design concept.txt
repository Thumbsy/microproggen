There are two main components: the main function and an interrupt based on TIMER0.
The interrupt will be used to time the notes (length of notes and BPM of the tune) and to select the to-be-played note.
The main function consists of an endless loop that will play a note from the table.

1. Initialize all needed components (load timer and DDR registers with values and stuff)
2. Select first note from the table.
3. Play note.
4. Then follows the timer interrupt which will switch off note playback. At the same time, a smaller value is loaded into OCR0 to create a short silence.
5. The timer interrupt kicks in again and selects the next note while activating note playback again. OCR0 is loaded with a bigger value again for note length.
6. Play next note.
7. Step 3 to 5 are repeated endlessly.
